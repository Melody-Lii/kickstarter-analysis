# Conclusion
!based on findings, failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundrasing goals than successful Kickstarter campaign.Louise is asking for more than twice the average successful Kickstaer goal which is not good to her. The mean and median pledged amounts are much lower than the successful pledges, which indicates that failed Kickstarter campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than asking for too much money. The median is much lower, there must be another factor keeping people from pledging to those unsuccessful projects
